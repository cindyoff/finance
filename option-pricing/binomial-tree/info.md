## Some concepts explained
### Binomial model
This model is an option valuation method, created by Sharpe, in 1978, and then further developed by Cox, Ross and Rubinstein a year later. 
The model assumes that the stock price has only two possible movements : up or down. Many paths can be created for this stock price. Therefore, the binomial structure shows the set of potential evolution of that stock price. Furthermore, this methodology assumes that the stock price follows a random walk.
